        "You will use a (a modified version of a) dataset named HAM10000 (\"Human Against Machine with 10000 training images\")  (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DBW86T). The dataset contains dermatoscopic images from different populations, acquired and stored by different modalities. The original dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images, in 600x450x3 pixel resolution, which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes.  Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions: Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec), basal cell carcinoma (bcc), benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl), dermatofibroma (df), melanoma (mel), melanocytic nevi (nv) and vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).\n",
        "\n",
        "More than 50% of lesions are confirmed through histopathology (histo), the ground truth for the rest of the cases is either follow-up examination (follow_up), expert consensus (consensus), or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy (confocal).\n",
        "\n",
        "For this exercise we have downsampled the images to 100x75x3 and randomly taken 1400 samples from the original 10015 to make training times more reasonable. We have also made the dataset more balanced in terms of class distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure you have downloaded the `HAM1400_100_75.zip` file from Canvas to your computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some tips and tricks (colab):\n",
        "* Copy the dataset to google drive and copy it to the colab workspace instead of uploading it. This will save you time, if don't finish the exercise in one go.\n",
        "* If you feel adventurous you can download and try some of the other resolutions and datasets (available in Canvas). There are 100x75, 256x192, 600x450 resolutions of images and the full datasets with ~10000 images and the \"downsampled\" datasets with 1400 images. If you use any of the other be prepared for looooong training times.\n",
        "* You may also want to experiment with changing runtime in google colab (too eg GPU) and see how much faster training will be. **PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MIGHT GET THROWN OUT OF USING GPU/TPU RUNTIMES. ONLY THE CPU RUNTIMES ARE FREE.**\n",
        "\n",
